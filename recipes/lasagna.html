    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the type of noodle or to the typical lasagna
        dish which is a dish made with several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as meats
        and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 ½ large zucchinis, thinly sliced lengthwise </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups low-carb marinara sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>aluminum foil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Pat dry zucchini slices with a paper towel to remove excess moisture. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add ground beef; cook until browned, 5 to 8 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add marinara sauce, 1 teaspoon salt, oregano, and pepper; simmer for 10 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine ricotta cheese, egg, 1 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg in a bowl; mix well. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Arrange one layer of zucchini slices in the prepared baking dish. Cover with 1/2 of the sauce. Add another
            layer of zucchini slices. Spread ricotta mixture on top. Sprinkle with 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Add
            another layer of zucchini slices; cover with remaining sauce and top with remaining mozzarella cheese and
            Parmesan cheese. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and bake until top is golden, about 15
            minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
